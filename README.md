This repository contains the initial stages of a simple interpreter, currently in development. Its current functionality focuses on tokenizing the input, breaking it down into smaller meaningful units.

Features:

Lexer: Parses input code into tokens (e.g., keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.).
Current Limitations:

Work in Progress: Actively under development and subject to future changes.
Getting Started:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/marianagg0412/DartInterpreter.git
Install dependencies: Dart

Using the Interpreter:

Enter code line by line when prompted by >>>.
Press Enter to submit each line.
Currently, the interpreter only prints the code unit of the first character of each line.
Type exit and press Enter to exit the interpreter.

This is a work in progress and may contain bugs or unfinished features. Use at your own discretion.
